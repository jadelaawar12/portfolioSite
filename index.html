        <h2>🌮 What I offer</h2>

        <h3>Dedicated Dev</h3>
        <p>
          Are you tired of hiring freelancers that just do some simple work then leave you with a half done project? Well, I am not like them when we work together I will stick to the very end and even prefer that as I enjoy it and lear a lot more when I am constantly working on a project. Also, payments will be split up per week so you won't have to pay a huge amount at once and have to worry about me not fullfiling the work as we will have daily/weekly updates.
        </p>
        <h3>Solidity Development</h3>
        <p>
          One of the things I can offer to do is solidity development. Here I will take charge of creating and optimizing smart contracts for your project by increasing its security as well as gas optimization. The smart contracts I can make range from basic NFT and token contracts to advanced contracts to govern dapps. Anything you can think  of I can make!  
        </p>
        <h3>Front-End</h3>
        <p>
            I can also build a front end for all your dapps. I can try using multiple JS libraries but the one I am most acquainted with is React. The front-ends I build for you will server the purpose of utilizing the smart contracts and allowing your users to do calls or run functions directly from your dapp!
